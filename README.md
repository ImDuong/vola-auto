# vola-auto
The ultimate streamline for Volatitlity 3. Speed up process of memory artifacts extraction phase

# Why this
- Why not a simple project using Volatility SDK? Frankly, Volatility 3 is written in Python, which makes the wrapper program should also be written in Python. And this is not what I want, because I just want to use Golang, and it's easy to cross compile for multiple OSes. 
- Why this project is developed? I want to accelerate the artifacts extraction phase and combine automatic artifact analytics strategy.
